|---|---|
|`ASN / IP registrars`|[IANA](https://www.iana.org/), [arin](https://www.arin.net/) for searching the Americas, [RIPE](https://www.ripe.net/) for searching in Europe, [BGP Toolkit](https://bgp.he.net/)|
|`Domain Registrars & DNS`|[Domaintools](https://www.domaintools.com/), [PTRArchive](http://ptrarchive.com/), [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/lookup), manual DNS record requests against the domain in question or against well known DNS servers, such as `8.8.8.8`.|
|`Social Media`|Searching Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, your region's major social media sites, news articles, and any relevant info you can find about the organization.|
|`Public-Facing Company Websites`|Often, the public website for a corporation will have relevant info embedded. News articles, embedded documents, and the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages can also be gold mines.|
|`Cloud & Dev Storage Spaces`|[GitHub](https://github.com/), [AWS S3 buckets & Azure Blog storage containers](https://grayhatwarfare.com/), [Google searches using "Dorks"](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)|
|`Breach Data Sources`|[HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to determine if any corporate email accounts appear in public breach data, [Dehashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) to search for corporate emails with cleartext passwords or hashes we can try to crack offline. We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication.|

#### Credential Hunting

[Dehashed](http://dehashed.com/) is an excellent tool for hunting for cleartext credentials and password hashes in breach data. We can search either on the site or using a script that performs queries via the API. Typically we will find many old passwords for users that do not work on externally-facing portals that use AD auth (or internal), but we may get lucky! This is another tool that can be useful for creating a user list for external or internal password spraying.

Note: For our purposes, the sample data below is fictional.
