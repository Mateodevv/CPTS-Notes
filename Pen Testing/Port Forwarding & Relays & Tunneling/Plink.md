#### Using Plink.exe

```cmd-session
plink -ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.15.50
```

#### Proxifier
Another Windows-based tool called [Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com/) can be used to start a SOCKS tunnel via the SSH session we created. Proxifier is a Windows tool that creates a tunneled network for desktop client applications and allows it to operate through a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy and allows for proxy chaining. It is possible to create a profile where we can provide the configuration for our SOCKS server started by Plink on port 9050.

After configuring the SOCKS server for `127.0.0.1` and port 9050, we can directly start `mstsc.exe` to start an RDP session with a Windows target that allows RDP connections.
